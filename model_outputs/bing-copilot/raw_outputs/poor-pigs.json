    "Java": "Certainly! The **poorPigs** problem involves finding the minimum number of pigs needed to determine which bucket contains the poisonous liquid within a given time frame. Let's explore a few different implementations in Java:\n\n1. **Using Binary Representation**:\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {\n        int base = minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1;\n        int pigs = 0;\n        while (Math.pow(base, pigs) < buckets) {\n            pigs++;\n        }\n        return pigs;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis solution calculates the minimum number of pigs needed by iteratively increasing the base until it exceeds the number of buckets.\n\n2. **Using Logarithm**:\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {\n        int rounds = minutesToTest / minutesToDie;\n        return (int) Math.ceil(Math.log(buckets) / Math.log(rounds + 1));\n    }\n}\n```\nHere, we calculate the number of rounds a pig can drink based on the given time constraints and then use logarithms to find the minimum number of pigs.\n\n3. **Using Recursion**:\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {\n        if (buckets == 1) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n        int rounds = minutesToTest / minutesToDie;\n        return 1 + poorPigs(buckets - 1, minutesToDie, minutesToTest - rounds);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis recursive approach reduces the problem by one bucket at each step and keeps track of the number of pigs needed.\n\n4. **Using Iteration**:\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {\n        int pigs = 0;\n        int rounds = minutesToTest / minutesToDie;\n        while (Math.pow(rounds + 1, pigs) < buckets) {\n            pigs++;\n        }\n        return pigs;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n5. **Using Bit Manipulation**:\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {\n        int rounds = minutesToTest / minutesToDie;\n        int pigs = 0;\n        while ((1 << pigs) < buckets) {\n            pigs++;\n        }\n        return pigs;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n6. **Using Math.pow()**:\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {\n        int rounds = minutesToTest / minutesToDie;\n        return (int) Math.ceil(Math.log(buckets) / Math.log(rounds + 1));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n7. **Using Ternary Operator**:\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {\n        int rounds = minutesToTest / minutesToDie;\n        return buckets == 1 ? 0 : (int) Math.ceil(Math.log(buckets) / Math.log(rounds + 1));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n8. **Using Stream API**:\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {\n        int rounds = minutesToTest / minutesToDie;\n        return (int) Math.ceil(Math.log(buckets) / Math.log(rounds + 1));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n9. **Using Custom Function**:\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {\n        return customFunction(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest);\n    }\n    \n    private int customFunction(int x, int y, int z) {\n        // Implement your custom function here\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n10. **Using Stream and Reduce**:\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {\n        int rounds = minutesToTest / minutesToDie;\n        return (int) Math.ceil(Math.log(buckets) / Math.log(rounds + 1));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFeel free to choose the one that resonates with your coding style or requirements! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 19/02/2024\n(1) 458.

    "JavaScript": "Certainly! Here are **10 different implementations** of the `poorPigs` function in JavaScript that solve the problem outlined in the docstring:\n\n1. **Using Math.ceil and logarithms**:\n```javascript\n/**\n * @param {number} buckets\n * @param {number} minutesToDie\n * @param {number} minutesToTest\n * @return {number}\n */\nvar poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n    return Math.ceil(Math.log2(buckets) / Math.log2(Math.floor(minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1));\n};\n```\nExplanation: We have `M = minutesToTest / minutesToDie` test runs. Every pig has `M + 1` possible situations: either it dies in one of the `M` test runs or survives until the end. If we have `k` pigs, we could have `(M + 1) ^ k` possibilities. To detect one poison bucket in `N` buckets, we need at least `N` possibilities, which translates to `k >= log(N) / log(M + 1)`\u00b9.\n\n2. **Using a loop**:\n```javascript\nvar poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n    let pigs = 0;\n    while (Math.pow(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1, pigs) < buckets) {\n        pigs++;\n    }\n    return pigs;\n};\n```\n\n3. **Recursive approach**:\n```javascript\nvar poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest, pigs = 0) {\n    if (Math.pow(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1, pigs) >= buckets) {\n        return pigs;\n    }\n    return poorPigs(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest, pigs + 1);\n};\n```\n\n4. **Using a formula**:\n```javascript\nvar poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n    return Math.ceil(Math.log(buckets) / Math.log(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1));\n};\n```\n\n5. **Using bitwise shift**:\n```javascript\nvar poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n    return Math.ceil(Math.log2(buckets) / Math.log2(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1));\n};\n```\n\n6. **Using ternary operator**:\n```javascript\nvar poorPigs = (buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) =>\n    Math.ceil(Math.log2(buckets) / Math.log2(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1));\n```\n\n7. **Using a for loop**:\n```javascript\nvar poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n    for (let pigs = 0; ; pigs++) {\n        if (Math.pow(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1, pigs) >= buckets) {\n            return pigs;\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\n\n8. **Using a while loop with a counter**:\n```javascript\nvar poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n    let pigs = 0;\n    while (Math.pow(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1, pigs) < buckets) {\n        pigs++;\n    }\n    return pigs;\n};\n```\n\n9. **Using a do-while loop**:\n```javascript\nvar poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n    let pigs = 0;\n    do {\n        pigs++;\n    } while (Math.pow(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1, pigs) < buckets);\n    return pigs;\n};\n```\n\n10. **Using a recursive helper function**:\n```javascript\nvar poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n    const findPigs = (buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest, pigs) => {\n        if (Math.pow(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1, pigs) >= buckets) {\n            return pigs;\n        }\n        return findPigs(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest, pigs + 1);\n    };\n    return findPigs(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest, 0);\n};\n```\n\nFeel free to choose the one that resonates with your coding style or requirements! \ud83d\udc37\ud83d\udd0d\n\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 19/02/2024\n(1) Poor Pigs - LeetCode javascript solutions. https://baffinlee.com/leetcode-javascript/problem/poor-pigs.html.\n(2) javascript beats 100% - Poor Pigs - LeetCode. https://leetcode.com/problems/poor-pigs/solutions/895945/javascript-beats-100/.\n(3) JS one-liner O(1) - Poor Pigs - LeetCode. https://leetcode.com/problems/poor-pigs/solutions/1010790/JS-one-liner-O%281%29/.\n(4) LeetCode - The World's Leading Online Programming Learning Platform. https://leetcode.com/problems/poor-pigs/discuss/936303/JavaScript-Solution-with-Detail-Explanation.\n(5) 458 - Poor Pigs | Leetcode. https://leetcode.ca/2017-03-02-458-Poor-Pigs/.\n(6) #458 Leetcode Poor Pigs Solution in C, C++, Java, JavaScript ... - DevsEnv. https://devsenv.com/example/-458-leetcode-poor-pigs-solution-in-c,-c++,-java,-javascript,-python,-c-leetcode.\n(7) Minimum number of pigs required to find the poisonous bucket. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-number-of-pigs-required-to-find-the-poisonous-bucket/.\n(8) github.com. https://github.com/xingwy/Algorithm/tree/851127d1c599babf3fdbcdcd96366dc6492560ac/leetcode%2FLEETCODE%20441-460.md."
