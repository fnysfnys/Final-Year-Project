    "JavaScript": "To solve this problem, we need to create a JavaScript function that calculates the minimum number of pigs required to identify the poisonous bucket within the given constraints. The key to solving this problem is understanding that it's a problem of encoding information (which bucket is poisonous) in the states of the pigs (alive or dead) over a series of rounds (testing periods). Each pig can provide a binary (yes/no) answer to a set of buckets in each round, which is effectively a binary digit (bit). The strategy is to use these rounds efficiently to test multiple buckets.\n\nHere are 10 different JavaScript code snippets for the `poorPigs` function, each with a slight variation in the approach or style, but all adhering to the original docstring:\n\n1. **Basic Mathematical Approach:**\n   ```javascript\n   var poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n       let rounds = Math.floor(minutesToTest / minutesToDie);\n       return Math.ceil(Math.log(buckets) / Math.log(rounds + 1));\n   };\n   ```\n\n2. **Using While Loop:**\n   ```javascript\n   var poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n       let pigs = 0;\n       while (Math.pow(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1, pigs) < buckets) {\n           pigs++;\n       }\n       return pigs;\n   };\n   ```\n\n3. **For Loop Variation:**\n   ```javascript\n   var poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n       let pigs = 0;\n       for (; Math.pow(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1, pigs) < buckets; pigs++);\n       return pigs;\n   };\n   ```\n\n4. **Using Recursion:**\n   ```javascript\n   var poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n       const test = (rounds, pigs) => Math.pow(rounds + 1, pigs) >= buckets ? pigs : test(rounds, pigs + 1);\n       return test(Math.floor(minutesToTest / minutesToDie), 0);\n   };\n   ```\n\n5. **Explicit Binary Encoding Approach:**\n   ```javascript\n   var poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n       let rounds = Math.floor(minutesToTest / minutesToDie);\n       let pigs = 0;\n       while ((1 << pigs) < Math.pow(rounds + 1, pigs)) {\n           pigs++;\n       }\n       return pigs;\n   };\n   ```\n\n6. **Using a Ternary Operator:**\n   ```javascript\n   var poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n       return Math.ceil(Math.log(buckets) / Math.log(Math.floor(minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1));\n   };\n   ```\n\n7. **Verbose Explanation in Code Comments:**\n   ```javascript\n   var poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n       // Calculate how many rounds we can have\n       let rounds = Math.floor(minutesToTest / minutesToDie);\n       // Calculate the minimum number of pigs needed\n       let pigs = 0;\n       while (Math.pow(rounds + 1, pigs) < buckets) {\n           pigs++;\n       }\n       return pigs;\n   };\n   ```\n\n8. **Function with Error Handling:**\n   ```javascript\n   var poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n       if (minutesToDie > minutesToTest) {\n           throw new Error('Invalid input: minutesToDie cannot be greater than minutesToTest');\n       }\n       return Math.ceil(Math.log(buckets) / Math.log(Math.floor(minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1));\n   };\n   ```\n\n9. **ES6 Arrow Function:**\n   ```javascript\n   const poorPigs = (buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) => \n       Math.ceil(Math.log(buckets) / Math.log(Math.floor(minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1));\n   ```\n\n10. **Function with Input Validation:**\n    ```javascript\n    var poorPigs = function(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {\n        if (buckets < 1 || minutesToDie < 1 || minutesToTest < 1) {\n            throw new Error('All input values must be greater than 0');\n        }\n        let rounds = Math.floor(minutesToTest / minutesToDie);\n        return Math.ceil(Math.log(buckets) / Math.log(rounds + 1));\n    };\n    ```\n\nEach of these snippets solves the problem using slightly different logic or syntax, but all adhere to the constraints and goals outlined in the original docstring."
